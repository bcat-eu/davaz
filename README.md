## About
We want to digitalize the full Davatz, Davats, Taffattz, Davaz, etc. family tree using the [Gramps Project](https://gramps-project.org).

## Davaz Family tree
We use [Gramps XML format](https://gramps-project.org/wiki/index.php/Database_Formats): 
Export > Gramps XML (we have no media) > No compression (for clearer diffs) > davaz.gramps.
